EFI file for succesfull hackintosh **Big Sur** for Acer Nitro 5 AN517-52

1. **CPU:** Intel Core i7-10750H comet lake
2. **iGPU:** Intel UHD graphics 630
3. **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 2060 mobile
4. **Ram:** 2\*8GB 2933 MHz
5. **Touchpad:** Elan I2C F
6. **Ethernet:** Killer E2600
7. **WiFi:** Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX201
8. **Main system was:** Windows 10

After a few weeks of effort, I'm here too. I tried catalina, but after a few days I found that there are a lot of things I can't work with. There are apps in the appstore that only work since BigSur - garageband, xcode, etc... I can share my EFIs, they worked the same on both Catalina and BigSur.

PS. I can help with your EFI on Acer Nitro 5, because I didn't see a lot of working hackintosh (on this laptop). And BigSur work better on my laptop then Catalina - I used to get apps crashing. Opencore 0.7.1. getting me a lot of problems, so **I need to use 0.7.0.**

What doesn't work yet:
* Audio jack. Internal sounds work.
* Bluetooth - I tried a lot thing, but unsuccessful
* Some apps don't work on BigSur like Intel Power Gadget.

Fixed:
* Sleep

**I already close this project. It was really cool to have Mac on my AcerðŸ˜† But it's gone from my laptop. I hope you will get where you want to!**
You can use my EFI, but most of laptops are different, so you can try change some kexts and don't forget to refresh yout **config** file!
